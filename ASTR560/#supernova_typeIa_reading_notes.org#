** NOTE 


* Iben & Tutukov 1984
** NOTE Go through general overview in the intro
   - What are SN Ia? Binary
   - SNIa rates?
   - The variants they propose for mass infall onto a WD
   - He vs. CO vs. ONeMg WD
   - Mass loss stuff (top of page 340, col 1)
   - /Summary/: They essentially go through all of the binary
     accretion mechanisms onto a compact WD for a SN Ia to occur 
** NOTE The five regimes of CO WD evolution in a binary depending on accretion rate
   - See stuff at bottom of second column on page 341 and
     through the rest of the section
   - Talk through differences between the different types
     of WDs
** NOTE Donor with degenerate He Core
   - Companion becomes red giant with puffed up envelope
   - They show that accretion from this RGB companion onto a WD
     can create M > 1.3 M_sun
** NOTE Donor with a degenerate CO core
   - Same thing as above but with AGB stars
   - But this is less likely to occur because the AGB star will
     likely form a common envelope with the WD, plus the mass
     accretion rate would be very small so the initial M_WD > 1.3 M_sun
** NOTE WD Masses
   - WDs are not really observed with M > ~1.2M_sun, but a
     M_WD ~ 1.3 M_sun is necessary for a Type Ia SNe to occur
   - They conclude that these WDs must exist
** NOTE Planetary Nebula Formation
   - Form via a common envelope phase, followed by a planetary nebula
     phase, followed by a secondary common envelope
   - About 1/4 of binaries produce a planetary nebula
** NOTE Stellar Wind as an accretion Catalyst
   - Strong stellar winds can push mass across the Roche Lobe,
     overflowing earlier than expected with a simple expansion model
   - This still requires M_WD ~ 1.35 M_sun, which doesn't solve
     the previous issues!
** NOTE Cataclysmic systems with CO/ONeMg WD & a MS Star
   - Binary of WD with MS star
   - Some may end up as single-degenerate WDs while others go SN Ia
** NOTE He-Dwarf plus MS Star
   - realization fraction is ~1e-3 yr^-1 for these to produce SN Ia's
** NOTE Double Degenerate Systems
   - Two CO WDs: Fig. 1 (Formation Scenario 1) and Fig. 2 (Formation Scenario 2)
   - CO WD & He WD: Fig. 3, basically the same process, except a wide binary
     system can also form a CO Dwarf rather than SNI if the accretion rate is
     high
   - Two He WDs: Fig. 4
** NOTE Summary of rates
   - He-He mergers: 0.15/yr
   - He-CO mergers and CO-CO mergers: 0.02/yr
** NOTE Red Giant Star as Donor
   - This would imply that the spectrum should have some Hydrogen in it
   - It doesn't so this is unlikely the case? (I think this is wrong
     from this paper, some Type Ia's do have trace amounts of Hydrogen)
** NOTE Low-mass X-ray Binaries
   - The capture of neutron stars by low-mass binaries in the dense
     cores of clusters appears to be an efficient way of creating LMXB
** NOTE Summary
   - Go through Table 1, Figs. 5 & 6
   - Bottom Line: We don't know what is going on! Because there is no
     Hydrogen seen in the spectra and the only case where this could
     be true is the double degenerate one. Although, now we know that
     this pathway is not what is occuring regularly. 
** QUES How can SNIa's be standard candles if there are so many possible formation and explosion pathways???
