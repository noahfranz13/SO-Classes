We observed the TDE AT2024wsd with the Kuiper 61'' telescope on Mt. Graham on the night of October 18-19, 2024 (Local Date). A summary of the Target and Calibration observations is given in Table \ref{tab:obs}. We observed the target with the Mont4k CCD in the Harris- R, B, V and Bessell- U filters. These filters are near identical to the standard Johnson/Cousin filter set. The flat images were taken with the dome flat capability of the Kuiper 61'' telescope. The bias and dark images were taken using standard methods. While this telescope is not typically used for transient followup observations, our observing time for class provided a unique opportunity to test it's capabilities. 

\subsection{Data Calibration}
We performed standard bias calibration by stacking the bias images using an average with sigma clipping. The sigma clipping used a $\pm 5 \sigma$ threshold to smooth the images over extreme outliers (e.g. hot pixels, cosmic rays, etc.). In future calibration steps, we use the same stacking parameters as used for the bias images. From the bias images, we estimate the read noise by subtracting off a random bias image from the master bias image ten times to create ten bias difference images. Since the bias images include both read noise and persistent detector signal, this renormalizes the bias images and removes extraneous outliers, leaving behind just the extra current due to read noise. Finally, we take the standard deviation of all of these images to find the read noise and convert from ADU to electrons using the gain  $G=3.1~e/ADU$ of Mont4k\footnote{https://james.as.arizona.edu/~psmith/61inch/CCD/basicinfo.html}.

After stacking the bias images, we apply them to each dark image to remove the CCD bias and leave behind just the dark current. We then stack the dark images by exposure time, leaving us with a master 5s, 30s, and 50s dark image. This is necessary for calibrating the Flat images, which were taken at 5s and 30s, and target images, which were taken at 50s. From the dark images, we estimate the dark noise by computing the mean pixel count for each dark image and then performing a linear fit to the mean pixel count as a function of exposure time. This gives us a dark current in electrons per pixel per second. Since dark current is a poissonian process, we simply take the square root of the dark current to find the dark noise (i.e. the shot noise of the dark current) and convert from ADU to electrons using the gain $G=3.1~e/ADU$ of Mont4k. 

To calibrate the flat images, we apply the master bias and then the master dark corrections. For the Harris- B, R, V flat images we use the 5s dark correction and for the Bessell-U flat image we use the 30s dark correction. We then stack the flat images to create one flat for each filter. The flats are not used to estimate any of the noise sources.

  \label{fig:targ}
\end{figure}

Finally, we apply all of these calibrations to the target images. First, we bias correct the target images using the master bias. Then, we subtract the 50s master dark image from the target images. Last, we apply the flat correction for the corresponding filter. Then, we stack all of the corrected target images by filter to give 4 science images. This leaves us with the images in Figure \ref{fig:targ}.    

\subsection{Signal Extraction and Flux Calibration}
We compute the sum of the ADU counts from the target using an circular aperture centered at the target coordinates, (RA, Dec) = (05:26:38.320, -17:54:54.68), with a 5'' radius. This includes the entirety of the visibly noticeable increase in counts over the background due to the target. The apertures for each filter are shown as red circles in Figure \ref{fig:targ}. The counts from each aperture are shown in Figure \ref{fig:aperture-counts}. These count histograms appear very Gaussian which likely means we are pushing up against the point spread function of the telescope and instrument. To find the sum of the ADU counts within the aperture, we simply integrate over these count histograms. 

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../analysis/aperture-counts-hist.png}
  \caption{caption}
  \label{fig:aperture-counts}
\end{figure}

We convert the sum of the counts from the target plus background to electrons using the gain $G=3.1~e/ADU$. Then, to convert from electrons to photons, we assume a throughput $T=85.78\%$ which is derived assuming the primary mirror has a $93\%$ reflectivity and that there are four other optics between the primary mirror and detector that each have an individual throughput of $98\%$. Combining these gives a throughput $T=(0.93)(0.98)^4=0.8578$. We also assume a constant quantum efficiency $Q=70\%$\footnote{\textcolor{red}{FILL IN!!!}}. Using the throughput and quantum efficiency, we convert from electrons to photons incident on the telescope by multiplying the electron counts by $1/(T \times Q)$. These counts, in ADU, electrons, and photons are given in Table \ref{tab:res}.

To estimate the background signal, we use an annulus aperture centered on the target coordinates and with an inner radius of 5'' and outer radius of 10''. We chose to use an annulus to estimate the background because, by visual inspection of the images, the background rate varies by $\sim300$ counts ($\sim25\%$) across the image. This is likely because the target was near the setting moon which created a gradient of background illumination. Therefore, we want a local estimate of the background rather than a global one when estimating it to subtract it from the target counts. After integrating over the counts in the annulus, we take the average to find the background counts per pixel. We then subtract the background counts, multiplied by the area of the target aperture, from the target aperture counts to find the signal coming just from the target itself. We follow the same procedure as with the target aperture to convert from ADU to electrons and photons. The background estimation and subtraction results are in Table \ref{tab:res}.

Once we have a background subtracted signal, we need to convert from photon counts to physical units. To do this, we query the ViZieR data service for Johnson/Cousins magnitudes in our field of view. We follow the same procedure as used for the target for each of these stars in the field of view: 1) place an aperture the same size as the target aperture over each of these sources and find the sum of the counts; 2) Find and subtract the background using an annulus with the same dimensions as used for the target; and 3) Convert from ADU to electrons and photons. The aperture placed on each of these foreground stars is shown as a blue circle in Figure \ref{fig:targ}. Each of these foreground stars has synthetic Johnson/Cousins magnitudes generated from the Gaia BP and RP mean spectra of the sources \citep{gaiadr3,gaiadr3_syntphot} (VizieR catalog I/360/syntphot). Note that we choose to use the Johnson/Cousins filter system since it is very similar to the Harris and Bessell filters but a more common standard. This, of course, introduces a level of systematic uncertainty into our magnitude calculation but this is negligible compared to the large uncertainties on our flux calculations (for example, see Figure \ref{fig:lc}). From these synthetic magnitudes, we find the zero point, $f_0$ of each filter using equation \ref{eq:f0},

\begin{align}
  f_{0,\gamma} = f_\gamma \times 10^{0.4 * m_\lambda},\label{eq:f0}
\end{align}

where $f_\gamma$ is the photon count flux and $m_\lambda$ is the synthetic magnitude of the source in a given filter.

We take the median of the computed zero points from each of these foreground stars to find a single zero point for the Mont4k detector. We choose to use the median to make our zero point calculation robust to outliers like variable stars or possible contaminating galaxies. The calculated zero points in photon counts are listed in Table \ref{tab:res}. Using the computed zero points we calculate the magnitude for each filter of our source using the standard flux-magnitude equation,

\begin{align}
  m_\lambda = -2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{f_\gamma}{f_{\gamma,0}}\right),
\end{align}

where the variables have the same meaning as equation \ref{eq:f0}. We compute the uncertainty in these magnitudes using standard error propagation on the noise in the photon count flux,

\begin{align}
  \sigma_m = 
\end{align}
