* Gallagher & Starrfield 1978

** NOTE Go through the definition of a Nova (red box on first page)
** NOTE Pre- and post- novae
   - prenovae compared to postnovae studies show that novae are nondestructive
   - postnovae show evidence for binary systems in some cases
** NOTE Primary and Seconday Properties
   - Period-luminosity relation in novae binaries?
   - Spectra of primary shows a complex and poorly understood system
   - Little is known about the masses of these objects. Has this changed?
** NOTE Light Variations (Flickering)
   - Some novae have periodic "flickering" on top of their normal light curve
** NOTE Mass Transfer Rate and Luminosity
   - ~10^-7 M_sun/yr
   - L ~ 10^37 erg/s (so much smaller than a SN!)
   - Mechanism that drives mass transfer is uncertain
** NOTE The accretion disk
   - Gas from secondary flows into accretion disk surrounding primary
   - In dwarf novae, the bright spot in the accretion disk and the
     disk itself are the primary sources of flux. In classical novae
     the accretion onto the WD is the primary source of flux.
** NOTE Outburst Light Curve
   - Go through Figure 1 of nova V603 Aql. Discuss quasi-periodic fluctuations
     in the decay tail.
     - This portion of the LC are from interactions with CSM
     - Probably from quasi-periodic fluctuations in the hydrostatic
       remnant (which is convective)
   - Figure 2: Very slow decaying nova HR Del. Note that the visible and
     bolometric luminosity of nova do not have the same evolution. (Remind
     everyone that we are at the forefront of UV and IR rocket launches)
   - Figure 3: Moderate speed nova FH Ser 1970. IR "excess", probably due to dust,
     see yellow boxed region on page right after figure
** NOTE Outburst Spectrum
   - Differences between fast and slow nova
   - Pre-max spectrum has prominent absorption features, less emission
   - Near-max spectrum shows emission from nebular shell and P-cygni profile
     lines indicating that we are observing a shell (CSM or wind?)
   - Post-max spectrum shows broad lines with high velocity
** NOTE Early nova envelope evolution can be broken down into
   1. Photosphere is expanding, reaching max radius around max brightness
   2. Photosphere begins to collapse at a rate dependent on the speed
      class of the nova
** NOTE Interestingly, Nova speed class is likely related to the post-max mass-loss rate
** NOTE Nova Theory
   - energy generation is 1e45 - 1e46 erg over a few days
   - Mass ejection processes: 1) shock ejection, 2) pressure ejection, and
     3) radiation-pressure driven
*** NOTE Nuclear reactions
   - Mass dump onto the surface of the WD creates CNO cycle elements
*** NOTE Slow Novae Model
   - Material ejection by radiation pressure
*** NOTE Fast Novae Model
   - Luminosity of WD has little effect on the thermonuclear explosion
   - Envelope mass strongly effects the outburst properties
   - WD Mass effect is unclear
   - Chemical Composition have strong effectgs on the outburst
     velocity, mass ejection, and peak luminosity because it changes the
     CNO enhancement
** NOTE The "Hydrostatic Remnant"
   - Only about 10% of the envelope is ejected, leaving behind most of
     the WD envelope in hydrostatic equilibrium. This implies a high
     luminosity remnant
   - Observations show that the remnants "cool" back down to their prenovae
     luminosity after a few years
   - This discrepancy is probably because models didn't account for
     "gravitational mixing"
     
** NOTE Postmaximum Phase
*** NOTE Emission Lines
   - Coronal lines present (??? this doesn't make sense)
   - Ionized state at late times is difficult to understand
     because a Stromgren-like analysis shows that the gas
     should only ionize after about 40 days
*** NOTE IR Observations
   - Little was known at this time about the IR evolution
   - 3 novae have been monitored in IR and show 3 different
     behaviors
   - Probably related to dust properties of CSM
     
** NOTE Ejecta Properties
*** NOTE Mass
   - Poorly understood, calculations are all over the place
*** NOTE Abundances
   - CNO are highly overabundant. They act like this is
     surprising but I feel like it isn't?
   - Predicted overabundance of Li, unclear if that is observed
*** NOTE Spatial Structure
   - Likely not spherical (four peaked line profiles)
   - They act like this is surprising but I feel like it shouldn't be


* Iben & Tutukov 1984
** NOTE Go through general overview in the intro
   - What are SN Ia? Binary
   - SNIa rates?
   - The variants they propose for mass infall onto a WD
   - He vs. CO vs. ONeMg WD
   - Mass loss stuff (top of page 340, col 1)
   - /Summary/: They essentially go through all of the binary
     accretion mechanisms onto a compact WD for a SN Ia to occur 
** NOTE The five regimes of CO WD evolution in a binary depending on accretion rate
   - See stuff at bottom of second column on page 341 and
     through the rest of the section
   - Talk through differences between the different types
     of WDs
** NOTE Donor with degenerate He Core
   - Companion becomes red giant with puffed up envelope
   - They show that accretion from this RGB companion onto a WD
     can create M > 1.3 M_sun
** NOTE Donor with a degenerate CO core
   - Same thing as above but with AGB stars
   - But this is less likely to occur because the AGB star will
     likely form a common envelope with the WD, plus the mass
     accretion rate would be very small so the initial M_WD > 1.3 M_sun
** NOTE WD Masses
   - WDs are not really observed with M > ~1.2M_sun, but a
     M_WD ~ 1.3 M_sun is necessary for a Type Ia SNe to occur
   - They conclude that these WDs must exist
** NOTE Planetary Nebula Formation
   - Form via a common envelope phase, followed by a planetary nebula
     phase, followed by a secondary common envelope
   - About 1/4 of binaries produce a planetary nebula
** NOTE Stellar Wind as an accretion Catalyst
   - Strong stellar winds can push mass across the Roche Lobe,
     overflowing earlier than expected with a simple expansion model
   - This still requires M_WD ~ 1.35 M_sun, which doesn't solve
     the previous issues!
** NOTE Cataclysmic systems with CO/ONeMg WD & a MS Star
   - Binary of WD with MS star
   - Some may end up as single-degenerate WDs while others go SN Ia
** NOTE He-Dwarf plus MS Star
   - realization fraction is ~1e-3 yr^-1 for these to produce SN Ia's
** NOTE Double Degenerate Systems
   - Two CO WDs: Fig. 1 (Formation Scenario 1) and Fig. 2 (Formation Scenario 2)
   - CO WD & He WD: Fig. 3, basically the same process, except a wide binary
     system can also form a CO Dwarf rather than SNI if the accretion rate is
     high
   - Two He WDs: Fig. 4
** NOTE Summary of rates
   - He-He mergers: 0.15/yr
   - He-CO mergers and CO-CO mergers: 0.02/yr
** NOTE Red Giant Star as Donor
   - This would imply that the spectrum should have some Hydrogen in it
   - It doesn't so this is unlikely the case? (I think this is wrong
     from this paper, some Type Ia's do have trace amounts of Hydrogen)
** NOTE Low-mass X-ray Binaries
   - The capture of neutron stars by low-mass binaries in the dense
     cores of clusters appears to be an efficient way of creating LMXB
** NOTE Summary
   - Go through Table 1, Figs. 5 & 6
   - Bottom Line: We don't know what is going on! Because there is no
     Hydrogen seen in the spectra and the only case where this could
     be true is the double degenerate one. Although, now we know that
     this pathway is not what is occuring regularly. 
** QUES How can SNIa's be standard candles if there are so many possible formation and explosion pathways???


* Maguire 2016 (Handbook of Supernova)
** NOTE Explosion Physics
   - Observational verification that exploding star is a WD (Bloom+2012)
   - Explosion mechanism is still controversial
   - Essentially, exceeding Chadrasekhar mass starts CO fusion which
     subsonically propagates through the WD. As the WD temp starts
     rising, fusion can't be regulated and it turns into a runaway effect.
   - Since all the mass is burnt and the initial mass is almost always
     1.37 M_sun (chandrasekhar mass) then the emitted energy should be
     constant
** NOTE Power Source
   - Radioactive decay of Iron group elements
   - 0.3-0.8 M_sun of Fe56 is produced per SNIa, making them main
     producers of Iron peak elements in universe
   - Arnett's rule relates the mass of Ni56 to the peak luminosity of the LC
** NOTE Observational Characteristics
*** NOTE Discovery
   - Large Optical All Sky Surveys with cadence of 2-5 days find ~100/yr
*** NOTE Light Curves
   - Show Fig. 1, talk about the two different slopes
   - 
** NOTE Light curve width-luminosity relation
   - The light curve require a correction by "stretch"
     which is essentially just correcting the maximum luminosity
     based on this width-luminosity reation
   - e.g. Fig. 2
   - More luminous SNIa's have broader LCs
   - Peak luminosity is directly related to the amount of Ni-56
     synthesized in the explosion

** NOTE Color-luminosity relation
   - B-band luminosity and B-V color are related for brighter SNIa's
   - Likely due to dust attentuation, doesn't this mean
     it should be related to the amount of dust too???

** NOTE Spectra
   - Large line width due to the high velocity ejects

*** NOTE Early-time spectra
   - Intermediate mass elements show broad absorption features
   - Fig. 3 shows an example of this for the earliest detected
     SNIa spectra
   - High velocity features are poorly understood, probably from
     CSM interactions

*** NOTE max-light spectra
   - Redder than pre-peak spectra, still dominated by intermediate
     mass elements
   - Iron lines become visible ~week after max light
   - Fig. 4: Most of the spectra are very similar near peak, major
     difference is the strength of some of the lines

*** NOTE Spectral-Luminosity Indicators
   - Hints of spectral line indicators of luminosity with small
     sample size, as sample size increased these did not hold

*** NOTE Late-time spectra
   - Dominated by forbidden Fe-group emission lines
   - See Fig. 5 for an example

** NOTE IR Properties
   - IR light reveals a secondary bump in the light curve
   - IR light curves at max light is relatively insensitive to Ni-56 mass
   - NIR properties of the H-band LC are standard candles with only
     a 4% deviation

** NOTE UV Properties
   - Similar to optical
   - More dispersion in the properties of the UV light curves than
     in the IR and optical

** NOTE Gamma-ray observations
   - Provide direct measurement of the amount of Ni-56 mass in the SNIa
     See Fig. 6

** NOTE Polarization
   - Generally weak polarization signal meaning that the ejecta
     is likely asymmetric

** NOTE Host galaxies
   - Wide variety of galaxies, star-forming and ellipticals
   - There is some dependence on the luminosity of the SNIa
     and the properties of the host

** NOTE Single-degenerate progenitor model
   - Primary WD accretes matter from a non-degenerate companion
   - This is difficult to make happen in models because the
     accretion rate must be finely tuned to avoid novae and disk
     winds pushing away material
   - More likely for novae than SNe

** NOTE Double-degenerate progenitor model
   - Possible tidal disruption and accretion of the less
     massive WD onto the primary
     - The main problem is that when this happens too
       quick, there is a runaway and the CO WD turns into an
       ONeMg WD
   - Violent mergers happen when GW bring the smaller WD close
     enough that it is simply accreted
   - Double detenation occurs when a surface detonation of
     Helium triggers the carbon detonation, tearing apart
     the star
   - Head on collision between two WDs

** NOTE Progenitor Signatures
   - Very little observational evidence of the single-
     degnerate case. Very constricting limits have
     been placed on the amount of hydrogen in WDs
   - CSM interactions aren't very helpful since a CSM is
     produced in most of the cases
   - No detection of Radio or X-ray emissio from SNIa
     which probably means the outflowing ejecta is not
     interacting with any CSM. Although radio observations
     did rule out the single-degernate cases
   - Progenitor direct detection has never been accomplished
     See Fig. 7 for a little summary (although this is kinda
     confusing
